# VitalCare - WebSite
Vital Care is an Angular and Firebase-powered web platform simulating a multi-specialty medical clinic. This demo application enables users to browse healthcare services, view doctor profiles with specialties, and book appointments through an integrated contact system. Leveraging Firebase for authentication, real-time database storage, and hosting, it delivers a responsive user experience that mimics real-world clinic operations.
